## ClassDef FedotDataSet
**FedotDataSet**: The function of FedotDataSet is to store a list of URLs related to the FEDOT framework documentation.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
Â· links: A list of strings, each representing a URL to a specific section of the FEDOT documentation.

**Code Description**: The `FedotDataSet` class is a simple Python class that initializes with a predefined list of URLs. These URLs are hyperlinks to various sections of the FEDOT (Framework for Evidential Deep Learning and Optimization Technologies) documentation. The `links` attribute is initialized in the `__init__` method, which is the constructor for the class. This constructor sets up the `links` attribute with a list of 26 URLs, each pointing to different parts of the FEDOT documentation, such as introduction, features, installation guides, examples, FAQs, basics, advanced topics, and API references.

**Note**: The `FedotDataSet` class does not include any methods for interacting with the `links` attribute or for performing any operations on the URLs. It is purely a container for the list of URLs. Users of this class would typically access or manipulate the `links` attribute directly, or use it as a reference to navigate the FEDOT documentation.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the object with a list of URLs.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The `__init__` function is a special method in Python classes, which is automatically called when a new instance of the class is created. In this specific implementation, the `__init__` method initializes an instance of the class by setting the `links` attribute to a list of URLs. Each URL in the list is a link to a documentation page related to the FEDOT framework. This setup allows the class instance to store and potentially manage or utilize these links for various purposes such as providing documentation resources, tutorials, or API references.

**Note**: The URLs provided in the `links` attribute are specific to the FEDOT framework's documentation and are intended to be used within the context of that framework. Users of this class should ensure that they understand the purpose and context of each URL to effectively utilize the resources provided.
