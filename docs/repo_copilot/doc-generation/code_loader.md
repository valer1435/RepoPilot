## ClassDef CodeLoader
 **CodeLoader**: The function of CodeLoader is to load and summarize code files from a repository.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· summaries: A dictionary to store summaries of code files.
· extensions: A list of file extensions to consider for loading. Default is ['.py'].
· model: The model used for generating summaries and documentation.
· summarize_prompt: A prompt template for generating summaries of code files.
· example_prompt: A prompt template for generating documentation pages for code examples.

**Code Description**: The CodeLoader class is designed to load and summarize code files from a repository. It inherits from JSONSerializable, indicating that instances of this class can be serialized to JSON. The class initializes with a model, optional extensions for file types to consider, and optional summaries. If no extensions are provided, it defaults to ['.py']. If no summaries are provided, it initializes an empty dictionary.

The summarize_prompt and example_prompt attributes are string templates used for generating summaries and documentation pages, respectively. These templates include placeholders for file content and source path, ensuring that the generated summaries and documentation are detailed and structured.

The class includes several methods:

1. **summary(self, document)**: This method generates a summary of a given document. It extracts the path and content from the document's metadata and page content, respectively. It then uses the model to invoke the example_prompt with the formatted content and path, returning the resulting summary.

2. **generate_docs(self, contexts)**: This method generates documentation from a list of contexts. It joins the contexts with a separator and uses the model to invoke a documentation prompt (self.doc_prompt), returning the resulting documentation.

3. **load_python_files(self, directory_path)**: This method recursively loads the content of all .py files in the specified directory and its subdirectories into LangChain documents. It uses a helper function, traverse_directory, to traverse the directory structure. For each valid file, it reads the content, creates a Document object, and stores the summary in the summaries dictionary.

4. **load_data(self, url)**: This method creates rst doc files from folders. It retrieves the content from the summaries dictionary using the provided url, generates a unique doc_id using SHA-256 hashing, and returns a dictionary containing the doc_id and data.

**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code
- Ensure that the model used for generating summaries and documentation is properly configured and capable of handling the prompts.
- The load_python_files method assumes that the directory structure and file contents are accessible and readable.

**Output Example**: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
```json
{
  "doc_id": "a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0",
  "data": [
    {
      "content": "Summary of the code file...",
      "meta_data": {
        "url": "path/to/file.py"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, model, extensions, summaries)
 **__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the CodeLoader object with specified parameters and set up default values for summaries and extensions.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: The machine learning model to be used by the CodeLoader.
· extensions: A list of file extensions to be considered by the CodeLoader. If not provided, defaults to ['.py'].
· summaries: A dictionary containing pre-existing summaries for files. If not provided, defaults to an empty dictionary.

**Code Description**: The description of this Function.
The __init__ method initializes the CodeLoader object by setting up the necessary attributes. It first checks if the summaries parameter is provided. If it is, the self.summaries attribute is set to the provided summaries. If not, it defaults to an empty dictionary. Similarly, it checks if the extensions parameter is provided. If not, it defaults to a list containing the '.py' extension. The model parameter is directly assigned to the self.model attribute.

Two additional attributes, self.summarize_prompt and self.example_prompt, are initialized with detailed prompts for generating summaries and documentation pages for code examples, respectively. These prompts provide clear instructions on what information should be included in the summaries and how the documentation pages should be structured.

**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code
- Ensure that the model parameter is a valid machine learning model that can be used for summarization tasks.
- The extensions parameter should be a list of strings, each representing a file extension.
- The summaries parameter should be a dictionary where keys are file paths and values are the corresponding summaries.

**Output Example**: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
The __init__ method does not return a value. It initializes the CodeLoader object with the specified attributes and default values.

### FunctionDef summary(self, document)
 **summary**: The function of summary is to generate a summary of a given document.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· self: The instance of the class that this method belongs to.
· document: An object containing the content and metadata of the document to be summarized.

**Code Description**: The `summary` function takes a `document` object as input, which contains metadata and page content. The function extracts the source path from the document's metadata and the content from the document's page content. It then formats this content and path using an example prompt and invokes a model to generate a summary. The summary is returned as the output of the function.

This function is used within the `traverse_directory` method to summarize each valid file found in a directory. The `traverse_directory` method iterates through a directory, checks if each item is a valid file based on specified extensions, reads the content of these files, and then calls the `summary` function to generate summaries, which are stored in a dictionary.

**Note**: Ensure that the `document` object passed to this function contains both `metadata` and `page_content` attributes. The `metadata` should include a 'source' key with the path of the document.

**Output Example**: 
```
"This document, located at 'path/to/document.py', contains code that defines several functions and classes, including a main class with methods for data processing."
```
***
### FunctionDef generate_docs(self, contexts)
 **generate_docs**: The function of generate_docs is to generate documentation based on provided contexts.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· contexts: A list of strings where each string represents a context or a section of the documentation.

**Code Description**: The function `generate_docs` takes a list of contexts as input. It first joins these contexts into a single string, separated by a divider `\n------------\n`. This combined context string is then used to format a documentation prompt. The formatted prompt is passed to the `invoke` method of the `model` attribute of the class instance, which presumably interacts with a model to generate documentation. The content of the response from the model invocation is then returned as the output of the function.

**Note**: Ensure that the `model` attribute of the class instance is properly initialized and capable of handling the `invoke` method with the formatted prompt. Also, the `doc_prompt` attribute should be a string that can be formatted with the context string.

**Output Example**: 
```
"This is the generated documentation based on the provided contexts.
------------
Context 1: Details about the first section.
------------
Context 2: Details about the second section."
```

### FunctionDef load_python_files(self, directory_path)
 **load_python_files**: The function of load_python_files is to recursively load the content of all .py files in a specified directory and its subdirectories into LangChain documents.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· directory_path: A string representing the path to the directory from which to start the search.

**Code Description**: The description of this Function.
The `load_python_files` function begins by defining an inner function `traverse_directory` that takes a single argument `path`. This inner function is responsible for traversing the directory structure starting from the given path.

Within the `traverse_directory` function, the code iterates over each item in the directory specified by `path`. For each item, it constructs the full path (`item_path`) by joining the `path` and the item name. It then checks if the item is a directory or a file.

If the item is a directory, the function calls itself recursively to continue the traversal. If the item is a file and its extension matches any of the extensions specified in `self.extensions` (which are not shown in the provided code but are assumed to include `.py`), the function opens the file in read mode with UTF-8 encoding.

The content of the file is read into a variable `content`, and metadata is created with the source path of the file. If the content is not empty, a `Document` object is created with the content and metadata, and this document is summarized using the `self.summary` method (which is also not shown in the provided code). The summary is then stored in the `self.summaries` dictionary with the file path as the key.

After defining the `traverse_directory` function, the `load_python_files` function calls this inner function with the `directory_path` parameter to initiate the directory traversal and loading process.

**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code
- Ensure that the `self.extensions` attribute includes the `.py` extension to correctly identify Python files.
- The `self.summary` method must be defined to generate summaries of the loaded documents.
- The function assumes that the directory and files can be accessed and read without permission issues.
#### FunctionDef traverse_directory(path)
 **traverse_directory**: The function of traverse_directory is to recursively traverse a directory and summarize valid files based on specified extensions.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· path: The directory path to be traversed.

**Code Description**: The `traverse_directory` function is designed to recursively explore a directory specified by the `path` parameter. It iterates through each item in the directory, constructing the full path for each item using `os.path.join(path, item)`. The function checks if the item is a directory using `os.path.isdir(item_path)`. If the item is a directory, the function calls itself recursively to explore the subdirectory.

For files, the function checks if the file's extension matches any of the specified extensions stored in `self.extensions`. This is done using a generator expression within the `any()` function, which iterates over `self.extensions` and checks if the file name ends with any of these extensions. If a file matches the extension criteria, it is considered valid.

Valid files are then opened and read. The content of the file is read into memory using `utf-8` encoding. Metadata for the file, including the source path, is created and stored in a dictionary. The content and metadata are then passed to the `summary` function, which generates a summary of the document. The summary is stored in the `self.summaries` dictionary with the file path as the key.

This function effectively builds a summary of all valid files within a directory and its subdirectories, making it useful for quickly accessing the content of multiple files.

**Note**: Ensure that the `self.extensions` list is properly initialized with the desired file extensions to correctly identify valid files. Also, ensure that the `summary` function is correctly implemented and can handle the document content and metadata as expected.

***
### FunctionDef load_data(self, url)
 **load_data**: The function of load_data is to generate a unique document identifier and structured data from a given URL.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· url: A string representing the URL from which the content is to be loaded.

**Code Description**: The description of this Function.
The `load_data` function takes a single parameter, `url`, which is used to retrieve content from the `summaries` dictionary within the instance. The function first retrieves the content associated with the provided URL from the `summaries` dictionary. It then generates a unique document identifier (`doc_id`) by hashing the content using the SHA-256 algorithm. The hashed content is encoded in UTF-8 before being hashed. The function returns a dictionary containing the `doc_id` and a list of dictionaries, each containing the content and associated metadata (in this case, the URL).

**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code
- Ensure that the `summaries` dictionary is properly populated with content before calling this function.
- The `doc_id` is generated using the SHA-256 hash of the content, ensuring that the same content will always produce the same `doc_id`.

**Output Example**: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
```json
{
    "doc_id": "5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbddc8a3f6e6e6e6e6e6e",
    "data": [
        {
            "content": "Example content from the URL",
            "meta_data": {
                "url": "http://example.com"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
