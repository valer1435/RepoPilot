**Code Description**: The __init__ method is a special method in Python classes, automatically called when a new instance of the class is created. In this specific implementation, the __init__ method initializes an instance variable named `links`. This variable is a list containing URLs pointing to various documentation pages of the Fedot project. Each URL is a string that directs to a specific section or example within the Fedot documentation, covering topics from introductory information to advanced usage and API details.

**Note**: When using this class, it's important to note that the `links` attribute is read-only and is set during the object's initialization. Modifying the `links` list directly might not be advisable unless explicitly needed, as it could lead to inconsistencies in the provided documentation references.
